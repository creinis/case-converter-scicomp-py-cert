# Case Converter Program

# Step 1

# In this project, you are going to learn about list comprehensions in Python by building a program that 
# can take a camelCase or PascalCase formatted string and convert that to a snake_case formatted string.

# List comprehensions in Python are a concise way to construct a list without using loops or the 
# .append() method. Apart from being briefer, list comprehensions often run faster.

# Start defining a new function named convert_to_snake_case() that accepts a string named 
# pascal_or_camel_cased_string as input.

def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    pass
