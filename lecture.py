# Case Converter Program

# Step 1

# In this project, you are going to learn about list comprehensions in Python by building a program that 
# can take a camelCase or PascalCase formatted string and convert that to a snake_case formatted string.

# List comprehensions in Python are a concise way to construct a list without using loops or the 
# .append() method. Apart from being briefer, list comprehensions often run faster.

# Start defining a new function named convert_to_snake_case() that accepts a string named 
# pascal_or_camel_cased_string as input.

def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    pass

# Step 2

# Now create a new list named snake_cased_char_list inside the function. 
# You can use a set of empty square braces to create the new list.

# This list will hold the characters of the string after you have converted them to snake case.

def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    snake_cased_char_list = [] 

# Step 3

# Now that you have an empty list in place, you can start iterating through the input string 
# and start converting each character to snake case.

# Use a for loop to iterate through the pascal_or_camel_cased_string. 
# Make sure to name the target variable char which is short for character.

def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    snake_cased_char_list = []
    for char in pascal_or_camel_cased_string:
        pass
